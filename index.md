My first write up for Avery Smith's Data Analytics Accelerator, the task was to analyze the iFoods food delivery service data. The main focuses were:
 Customers purchases (most spent, least spent, average, total), 
 Marketing campaigns (which was most popular),
 Age demographics,
 and Number of new members signing up for the app (high and low months).

In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were:
What schools are struggling the most?

For this case study, I was tasked to do some initial exploratory analysis with SQL as a financial analyst with the World Bank.
A few questions with this analysis include: How many total transactions? How many total transactions per country? What is the max owed to the IDA? 
Which was the most recent to pay? Who has the most loans?
