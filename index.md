My first write up for Avery Smith's Data Analytics Accelerator, the task was to analyze the iFoods food delivery service data. The main focuses were:
 Customers purchases (most spent, least spent, average, total), 
 Marketing campaigns (which was most popular),
 Age demographics,
 and Number of new members signing up for the app (high and low months).
