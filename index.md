A few questions with this analysis include: How many total transactions? How many total transactions per country? What is the max owed to the IDA? 
Which was the most recent to pay? Who has the most loans?

In this latest case study, I have been hired as a healthcare data analyst at a hospital and will be working with patient data. As a new data analyst, some of my first tasks include a visualization of the distribution of time spent in the hospital, a list of the medical specialties with an average number of procedures, investigating if the hospital is subconsciously treating races differently, exploring the relationship between the number of lab procedures and time spent in the hospital, and list of the patients who had an emergency but left the hospital faster than the average.
