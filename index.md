My first write up for Avery Smith's Data Analytics Accelerator, the task was to analyze the iFoods food delivery service data. The main focuses were:
 Customers purchases (most spent, least spent, average, total), 
 Marketing campaigns (which was most popular),
 Age demographics,
 and Number of new members signing up for the app (high and low months).

In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were:

For this case study, I was tasked to do some initial exploratory analysis with SQL as a financial analyst with the World Bank.
A few questions with this analysis include: How many total transactions? How many total transactions per country? What is the max owed to the IDA? 
Which was the most recent to pay? Who has the most loans?

In this latest case study, I have been hired as a healthcare data analyst at a hospital and will be working with patient data. As a new data analyst, some of my first tasks include a visualization of the distribution of time spent in the hospital, a list of the medical specialties with an average number of procedures, investigating if the hospital is subconsciously treating races differently, exploring the relationship between the number of lab procedures and time spent in the hospital, and list of the patients who had an emergency but left the hospital faster than the average.
