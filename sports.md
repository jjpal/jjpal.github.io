# Tableau Sports Analytics Project

For this case study, I do some visual exploratory analysis with Tableau as a data analyst with a sporting team.

A few questions with this analysis include: 

What position is the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team?

How did different players score on total points, total assists, and total rebounds?

What are the total points scored by each team, and how did players on the team score?

What players had the most assists in every position?
