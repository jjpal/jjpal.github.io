# Visualizing Sports Analytics With Tableau üèÄ

Sports analytics came up in popularization, in part, by the real-world success illustrated by the 2003 book and 2011 motion picture Moneyball. 
Decision-making metrics can help teams on-field from which players to draft, trade, improve in-game strategies and nutrition plans to off-field to help monitor ticket and merchandise sales, improve fan engagement, and reduce operational costs. ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãIt uses data to measure areas like athletic performance and business health to optimize the processes and success as a whole - of a sports organization. 

Traditionally decisions were made by instinct - complying with old traditions, newspapers, trading card scores, television and radio media commentary. Advancements in technology, analytics evolution with sports teams allow analysts to use various tools, like predictive analytics, machine learning, data mining, and virtual simulations.

For this case study, I do some visual exploratory analysis with Tableau as a data analyst with a sporting team.

A few questions with this analysis include: 

What position is the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team?

How did different players score on total points, total assists, and total rebounds?

What are the total points scored by each team, and how did players on the team score?

What players had the most assists in every position?
