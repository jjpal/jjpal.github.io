# World Bank - SQL Financial Banking Project


For this case study, I was tasked to do some initial exploratory analysis with SQL as a financial analyst with the World Bank. 

A few questions with this analysis include: 

How many total transactions? 

How many total transactions per country? 

What is the max owed to the IDA? 

Which was the most recent to pay? Who has the most loans?
